Okay, I understand. I will wait for the task description. Once I receive it, I will formulate a step-by-step plan to achieve the task using the two robot arms, adhering to all the specified guidelines. I will explain each action I take.
place iphone in box
The current position(x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw) of roboter arm 1 is: [200.000336, -0.000266, 299.999878, -178.999979, 0.000115, 5.7e-05]
                           and its gripper position is:  848.0
The current position(x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw) of roboter arm 2 is: [        900       3e-06         300        -179           0          -0]
                           and its gripper position is:  840.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will start by getting the coordinates of the iPhone. Both robot arms are in their safe starting positions, and their grippers are open, which is ideal for this first step.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
get_object_pose
object_name
The pose/coordinates of the object iphone is: [     364.88       215.9      1.6179        -179           0     -35.538]

The current position(x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw) of roboter arm 1 is: [200.000336, -0.000266, 299.999878, -178.999979, 0.000115, 5.7e-05]
                           and its gripper position is:  848.0
The current position(x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw) of roboter arm 2 is: [        900       3e-06         300        -179           0          -0]
                           and its gripper position is:  840.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will now move robot arm 1 to the x and y coordinates of the iPhone, keeping its current z-coordinate of 300. The rotation coordinates will also be applied.

                           and its gripper position is:  840.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that robot arm 1 is above the iPhone, I will lower it to the iPhone's z-coordinate to prepare for grasping.

                           and its gripper position is:  840.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that robot arm 1 is in position, I will close its gripper to grasp the iPhone.

                           and its gripper position is:  840.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The grasp was successful as the gripper position is 554.0, which is greater than 10. I will now raise robot arm 1 to a safe height of z = 150.

I need to place the iPhone in the box. Since robot arm 1 is holding the iPhone and the box is on the right side of the table (reachable by robot arm 2), I will need to hand over the iPhone to robot arm 2. First, I will move robot arm 1 to its starting position to ensure a clear view for getting the box's coordinates.

I will now get the coordinates of the box so that I can plan the handover of the iPhone from robot arm 1 to robot arm 2, and then place it in the box.

I will now execute the handover of the iPhone from robot arm 1 to robot arm 2. The `hand_over_object` function will automatically position both robots for this action, using the iPhone's coordinates as the target for the handover.

I understand. The previous handover was interrupted, and now I need to hand the iPhone back to robot arm 1. Robot arm 2 is currently holding the iPhone, and robot arm 1's gripper is open. I will use the `hand_over_object` function with robot arm 2 as the master and robot arm 1 as the slave, using the last known coordinates of the iPhone.
